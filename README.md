	1. Go to the directory with all the files
	2. Make sure the makefile is there

Run the command ./test "path/to/text/files" 1 2
	- "path/to/text/files" is the directory where the files to check are stored
	- 1 is the length of the sequence to check (e.g. to check every 6 word sequence use 6)
	- 2 is the cutoff threshold for plagiarism in terms of collisions
